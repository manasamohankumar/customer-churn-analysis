# Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy
Telecommunications (Australia) — Business Analytics Project

# Project Overview
Australian telecommunications companies — including Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and TPG — face persistent customer churn challenges. Customer churn directly impacts recurring revenue and increases acquisition costs.

This project predicts customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset (Kaggle) and provides data-driven strategic recommendations for reducing churn.
The analysis covers:
  1. Customer behaviour patterns
  2. Key churn drivers
  3. Predictive modelling (Logistic Regression & Random Forest)
  4. Retention strategy for high-risk customers

# Business Problem
A mid-sized Australian telecom provider (“AussieConnect”) is experiencing a 26–27% churn rate. 
Leadership wants to:
  1. Understand why customers churn
  2. Identify high-risk customers
  3. Develop targeted retention strategies based on data

# Objectives
  1. Analyse customer demographics, usage behaviour, and service features
  2. Identify key churn predictors
  3. Build churn prediction models
  4. Evaluate performance and trade-offs
  5. Provide actionable business recommendations

# Tools & Techniques
  1. Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
  2. Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Train/Test Split)
  3. One-Hot Encoding & Feature Scaling
  4. EDA & Insight Storytelling
  5. Business Strategy Recommendations
