# Customer Churn Analytics – Telco

## 1. Business Understanding

### 1.1 Problem Statement

A telecom company is experiencing customer churn, meaning customers are cancelling their services. High churn reduces monthly revenue and increases acquisition costs because replacing a lost customer is more expensive than retaining an existing one. The company wants to understand why customers churn and identify the main drivers behind this behaviour. Using customer demographic, account, and service usage data, we will analyse patterns related to churn. The goal is to build a predictive model that identifies high-risk customers and provides actionable insights for targeted retention strategies.

### 1.2 Why Churn Matters Financially

Churn directly reduces the company’s recurring revenue and lifetime customer value. Acquiring a new telecom customer is typically 5–7 times more expensive than retaining an existing one, due to marketing, onboarding, and installation costs. High churn also impacts profitability and future cash flows. Predictive churn analytics helps reduce unnecessary revenue loss and improves the efficiency of marketing spend by focusing on customers most likely to leave.
